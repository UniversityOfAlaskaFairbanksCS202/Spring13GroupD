// Still trying to get the cinder files to work properly on my computer //
// Until then can someone try this out in their own code to see if it works properly? I'd appreciate it //
// This background is just a modded version of the Super Rough Sketch someone did last week //
// A more dynamic background will come in the future one I figure out cinder more //

// void CinderProjectTestingApp::setup(){} - just through it right in //
gl::Texture Background; 

// void CinderProjectTestingApp::draw(){} //
if(Background) {

// for this you might not even have to have the Vec2f() the image is already set to 800x600 so a straight 
// import should be fine. 
gl::draw(Background, Vec2f(800.0f, 600.0f)); 
}
